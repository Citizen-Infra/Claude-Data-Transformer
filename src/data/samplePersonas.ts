Our draft distinguishes between codified governance (explicit rules, voting procedures, membership criteria) and emergent governance (norms, trust patterns, conflict resolution habits). We argue the codified layer should be portable as a structured format. The emergent layer cannot be ported but it can be documented to help communities rebuild it.", created_at: "2026-02-12T09:15:00Z" },
